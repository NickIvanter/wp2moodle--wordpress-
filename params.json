{"name":"Wordpress 2 Moodle","tagline":"Log onto Wordpress, authenticate and enrol in Moodle on demand","body":"### Wordpress 2 Moodle\r\nMoodle is a great LMS, but it's not as flexible as Wordpress. Sure, it's got a few payment gateway plugins, and pretty good flexible authentication and enrolment systems, but nothing that tightly couples with Wordpress. This plugin lets you sign into wordpress, click a link that is embedded by a shortcode or downloadable product, and be authenticated and enrolled in a Moodle course. It's called Single Sign On, or SSO. It doesn't matter if your Wordpress and Moodle servers are on the same host or not. It doesn't matter if they run https or not. User is encrypted and verified.\r\n\r\n### Plugins\r\nThis plugin is actually two plugins, one for your Wordpress site, and one for your Moodle. There's an optional third (webservice) plugin also for older Moodle's that lets you gather course completion data and provides authentication tokens to users who signed in using wp2moodle. You'll need to grab and install these to make this work.\r\n\r\n - [Wordpress plugin](https://github.com/frumbert/wp2moodle--wordpress-)\r\n - [Moodle plugin](https://github.com/frumbert/wp2moodle-moodle)\r\n - (Optional) [Completion webservice](https://github.com/frumbert/wp2moodle-wscompletion)\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nTo try it out, head on over to http://wordpress.frumbert.org/ and register (use a junk account if you like). Click a link, see the course. That's pretty much all of it.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nJust use the Issue tracker on GitHub to raise any issues for each of the projects.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
